<h1 align="center"><project-name>Simon Game</h1>

<p align="center"><project-description>This project is a simple replica of the Simon game where the player has to try and recall the ever growing pattern.  This has been built with pure Javascript and uses Math.random and a tracking array to progress the game and validate whether the player has matched the pattern.
